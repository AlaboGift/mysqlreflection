# MySQLReflection
## A useful utility for the Object Relation Mapping of MySQL databases
The utility generates automatically PHP classes for any tables of a given database
schema.<br>
Package is extracted from my personal PHP Web MVC Framework<br>

To run the utility:

1) Set your database simple by modifying mysqlreflection.config.php file.
2) Then just run app_create_beans.php to launch utility GUI. 
3) Click "Generate Classes" button.

After running the utility you will find all generated classes into "beans"
folder.

Note:
- Auto generated classes are prefixed with "Bean".
- Each auto generated class uses bean\bean.config.php for configuration info.
- Each auto generated class uses Model.php and MySqlRecord.php


An auto generated MySQL class provides the following services:<br>
<ul>
    <li>A constructor for managing a fetched tableâ€™s row or for a adding a new one</li>
    <li>Management for both single or composite Primary Keys</li>
    <li>Automatic mapping of the different date formats may occurs between
        application and database</li>
    <li>Destructor to automatically close database connection</li>
    <li>Defines a set of attributes corresponding to the table fields</li>
    <li>Setter and Getter methods for each attribute</li>
    <li>OO methods for simplify DML select, insert, update and delete operations</li>
    <li>A facility for quickly updating a previously fetched row</li>
    <li>Useful methods to obtain table DDL and the last executed SQL statement</li>
    <li>Error handling of SQL statements</li>
    <li>Camel/Pascal case naming convention for Attributes/Class used for mapping
        Fields/Table</li>
    <li>Useful PHPDOC information about table, fields and the usage of class,
        attributes and methods.</li>
</ul>
Developers can quickly use these classes on their application.<br>
Into the beans directory are located some auto generated classes of a MySQL schema.<br>
DDL for MySQL schema is into a script file located into "sql" directory.<br>
There is also a simple tester script "app_run_bean.php" for showing usage of a generated class<br>
